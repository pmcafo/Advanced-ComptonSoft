Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Compton Soft is an integrated simulation and analysis software package
for semiconductor radiation detectors including Compton cameras.
This software provides

- processing data obtained with multi-layer semiconductor detector systems,
- Monte Carlo simulations of the semiconductor detector systems, and
- data reduction/analysis including Compton reconstruction.

This software package can be used for wide-range applications of radiation
measurements: X-/gamma-ray astrophysics, nuclear medicine, and imaging
search for radioactive sources.
